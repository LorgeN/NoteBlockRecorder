# Note Block Recorder

Simple Spigot plugin for recording noteblock output and storing it to a file so it can be played back via another plugin
or similar.

## Version

Please note that this plugin is based on 1.16, and does use NMS dependencies to get the current server tick. This could
very easily be abstracted out using simple reflection but I decided not to dedicate any time to doing that.
